        <h1>Analysing the relationship between Socio-Economic factors and Mens and Womens National Football Team Performance</h1>
        
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>My project looks at how Socio-Economic factors relate to Men's and Women's national football team performance, specifically attempting to understand if these factors can explain the difference between the strength of a Country's Men's and Women's Team. I think this is important as it may show how a Country's future development may influence their national teams, however, also look at Country's which are outliers and attempt to understand what they are doing right or wrong and how other Country's can learn from this. I will be mainly using the Percentage Difference between Country's Men's and Women's National Teams FIFA ranking points as this makes comparisons between country's easier as ranking points are not in nominal terms, furthermore, the FIFA ranking points system is the most generalisable and widely used metric for national team performance for both Men's and Women's National Teams.</p>
     
        
        <h3>Choropleth Map</h3>
        <p>This Choropleth Map shows the percentage difference between each country's Men's and Women's FIFA ranking points with a higher number representing a better Mens team compared to Womens. It shows a high number of countries in Africa and the Middle East with a much higher ranked Men's team compared to their Women's, as well as this there are a number of Country's without data in these regions which is due to them not having a ranked Women's team further illustrating the dominance of Men's football in these areas. In contrast East and Southeast Asia stand out as regions with relatively higher ranked Women's teams compared to their Men's.</p>

         <h3>Socio-Economic Factors and the difference between Men's and Women's National Teams</h3>
        <p>From the Choropleth Map it is clear that there is variance between Men's and Women's team performance. This chart shows the relationship between Country's GDP per Capita and Percentage difference between Men's and Women's FIFA ranking points, performing a Linear Regression revea;s a statistically significant at the 1% level (p value of 0.001) but weak (R Squared of 0.073) correlation, with higher GDP per Capita associated with a relatively better Men's team compared to Women's.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>
        
        
        <p>This next scatter plot shows the UN's Gender Inequality Index and the same Percentage difference between Men's and Women's teams. A Linear Regression upon this data illustrates a statistically significant relationship at the 1% level (p value of 0.000 and R Squared of 0.107) with a higher Gender Inequality Index (Less gender equal) associated with a better Men's team compared to their Women's.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart2"></div>
        
       
        <p>This chart shows HDI (UN Human Development Index) and Percentage difference between Men's and Women's teams. This relationship is the strongest out of the three and is statistically significant at the 1% level (p value of 0.000 and R Squared of 0.169), this suggests that perhaps as HDI takes into account both Economic and Socio-Political factors this combined indicator helps explain more of the difference between Country's Men's and Women's National Teams. This could be because wealthier country's may provide better facilities and opportunity for Football in general however, if the country is more gender unequal Women may not benefit proportionally from them.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart3"></div>
        
     <h3>Socio-Economic Factors and Women's National Team Performance</h3>
    <p>These charts illustrate how a much stronger correlation exists between Socio-Economic factors and a country's Women's National Team performance compared to the Percentage difference between Women and Men's teams. Both the UN's Gender Inequality Index and HDI have a statistically significant relationship at the 1% level with Women's FIFA ranking points, furthermore, both have an R Squared above 0.33 highlighting the strength of the relationship. This does suggest that greater development and gender equality for countries is associated with a better Women's football team. There are however, outliers with two significant ones labeled in the charts. In the next section I will analyse factors which are possibly responsible for these anomalies.</p>

       <h3>Anomalies</h3>
         <div id = "container">
         <img src="BrazilPizza.png" alt="PitcherTypes"
         width= "500"
         height= "400">
        <p>This visualisation helps to explain the strength of Brazil's Women's football team despite their relatively average HDI and Gender Equality levels. These factors are likely to be their large population size as shown in the chart and the widespread popularity of football in Brazil, which also influence their Men's team as well which is currently the best in the world. Furthermore, the performance of a country's Men's national team has the strongest relationship with a country's Women's national team (statistically significant at the 1% level with R Squared of 0.547) and due to Men's national teams being less correlated with socio-economic factors than Women's, the performance of Brazil's Men's national team has large value in explaining the strength of their Women's in spite of socio-economic factors.</p>
    </div>
    <div id = "container">
        <img src="MauritiusPizza.png" alt="PitcherTypes"
        width= "500"
        height= "400">
        <p>Mauritius is a harder anomaly to explain, although their low Women's FIFA ranking points is likely due to their low population and low Men's FIFA ranking points suggesting weak football popularity and/or infrastructure. However, this does not explain why Mauritius is the coutnry where their Men's team is best proportionally compared to their Women's, in fact their Men's team has 60% greater FIFA ranking points than their Women's which is 45% higher greater than the next country (Madagascar where their Men's team has 42% more). This is potentially due to Mauritius focusing on developing Women's rugby instead of football with the government ambitiously setting the goal of a Women's rugby team reaching the 2024 Olympics (Women in Rugby, 2020), as well as cultural problems within the Mauritius Football Association (Aarons and Molina, 2021). As well as this the percentage difference measure fails to take into account the countries which do not even have a ranked Women's national football team (shown in the choropleth map in grey), thus it may be unfair to declare Mauritius the country where Men's football dominates Women's the most as at least they have a ranked Women's football team.</p>
